## Introduction

"Luom" is a stealth-based game where players need to use their stealth skills to avoid the attention of enemies while carrying out missions. The game puts players in the role of Kim Dong (Nong Van Den), the first captain of the Youth Union Team to rescue the village of Na Ma. Through the game, players will experience Kim Dong's activities and learn about historical landmarks and figures in the Pac Bo region. This region was chosen by Uncle Ho as a revolutionary stronghold and played a significant role in the resistance against the French and the Americans by the Vietnamese people.
